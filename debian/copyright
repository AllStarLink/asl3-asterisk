Comment:
 File lacks copyright and licensing,
 but contains the comment
 "Conversion routines derived from code by guido@sienanet.it"
 which might be interpreted as
 a copyright holder not granting a license.
 More likely, however,
 the header file is considered non-copyrightable header
 with merely a remark about origin of inspiration:
 .
   * File was introduced in Asterisk 0.1.1
     (according to git sources),
     together with file format_wav_gsm.c containing same comment
     but also explicit copyright and licensing:
     <https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/0ed94773>.
 .
   * Asterisk 0.1.1 was released in 1999
     (according to git sources),
     at about which time Guido Giorgetti <guido@sienanet.it>
     released audio-related Delphi 3 code as "Freeware":
     <http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/authors/a0002451.htm>
     <http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/ftp/d30free/tmsgvoc.zip>

 Thank you for your trouble.
 I intended the software to be free.
 GPL is fine.

 which may seem like a copyright holder not granting a license.
 We instead assume
 that the file has same licensing as the project generally.

License: GPL-2-Asterisk
 Asterisk is distributed
 under the GNU General Public License version 2
 and is also available under alternative licenses
 negotiated directly with Digium, Inc.
 If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL,
 then the GPL applies to all loadable Asterisk modules
 used on your system as well,
 except as defined below.
 The GPL (version 2) is included in this source tree
 in the file <COPYING>.
 .
 This package also includes various components
 that are not part of Asterisk itself;
 these components are in the 'contrib' directory
 and its subdirectories.
 These components are also distributed
 under the GPL version 2 as well.
 .
 Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services)
 holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses
 to all components of the Asterisk package,
 and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
 for companies, individuals, or organizations
 to create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules
 which may be dynamically linked at runtime
 with the portions of Asterisk which fall
 under our copyright/license umbrella,
 or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.
 .
 If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs,
 don't worry -- there is no requirement
 that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products
 (although if you've written a module for Asterisk
 we would strongly encourage you
 to make the same exception that we do).
 .
 Specific permission is also granted
 to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323
 and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit
 and distribute the resulting binary files.
 .
 In addition,
 Asterisk implements two management/control protocols:
 the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)
 and the Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI).
 It is our belief that applications using these protocols
 to manage or control an Asterisk instance
 do not have to be licensed
 under the GPL or a compatible license,
 as we believe these protocols do not create a 'derivative work'
 as referred to in the GPL.
 However, should any court or other judiciary body find
 that these protocols do fall under the terms of the GPL,
 then we hereby grant you a license
 to use these protocols in combination
 with Asterisk in external applications
 licensed under any license you wish.
 .
 The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks
 owned by Digium, Inc.,
 and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies.
 If you wish to use these trademarks
 for purposes other than simple redistribution
 of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium,
 you should contact our licensing department
 to determine the necessary steps you must take.

  1. Definitions
     The terms 'reproduce,' 'reproduction,'
     'derivative works,' and 'distribution'
     have the same meaning here
     as under U.S. copyright law.
     A 'contribution' is the original software,
     or any additions or changes to the software.
     A 'contributor' is any person
     that distributes its contribution
     under this license.
     'Licensed patents' are a contributor's patent claims
     that read directly on its contribution.
  2. Grant of Rights
     (A) Copyright Grant
         Subject to the terms of this license,
         including the license conditions
         and limitations in section 3,
         each contributor grants you
         a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license
         to reproduce its contribution,
         prepare derivative works of its contribution,
         and distribute its contribution
         or any derivative works that you create.
     (B) Patent Grant
         Subject to the terms of this license,
         including the license conditions
         and limitations in section 3,
         each contributor grants you
         a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
         under its licensed patents
         to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import,
         and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution
         in the software
         or derivative works of the contribution in the software.
  3. Conditions and Limitations
     (A) No Trademark License
         This license does not grant you rights
         to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
     (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor
         over patents that you claim are infringed by the software,
         your patent license from such contributor to the software
         ends automatically.
     (C) If you distribute any portion of the software,
         you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark,
         and attribution notices
         that are present in the software.
     (D) If you distribute any portion of the software
         in source code form,
         you may do so only under this license
         by including a complete copy of this license
         with your distribution.
         If you distribute any portion of the software
         in compiled or object code form,
         you may only do so under a license
         that complies with this license.
     (E) The software is licensed "as-is."
         You bear the risk of using it.
         The contributors give no express warranties,
         guarantees or conditions.
          You may have additional consumer rights
         under your local laws
         which this license cannot change.
         To the extent permitted under your local laws,
         the contributors exclude the implied warranties
         of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose
         and non-infringement.
